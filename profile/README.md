# About 6G-GOALS

6G-GOALS aims to realize a sustainable wireless network ecosystem that relies on AI-empowered architecture to support semantic and goal-oriented communication protocols and services. 6G-GOALS will create a path towards building a sustainable 6G, featuring a drastic reduction in the number of unnecessary bits processed and sent and, consequently, enabling extreme energy and spectrum efficiency, reduction of EMF exposure, and massive machine-type communications.

This work has received funding from the Smart Networks and Services Joint Undertaking (SNS JU) under the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe research and innovation program under Grant Agreement No 101139232.
